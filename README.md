# Weekly Menu

A simple python based web scraper to get menu of the current week from two COOR restaurants. It will write the menu in a text file.

## Usage
The simplest way to use it as follows,
```
main.py
```

## Requirements
I used Anaconda with python3,
```
conda create -n <yourenvname> python=<3.x>
source activate <yourenvname>
conda install -n <yourenvname> --file requirements.txt
```
